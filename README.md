and

Data I want to pull to create character cards

Once the data console.log...

Started to work on appending to divs.
-Added bootstrap in HTML so I can create the cards using the bootstrap library
-Finsihed appending player card with submit form

Moved into HTML and CSS once character cards were completed
- Played around with background and navbar
- Added carousel underneath nav bar

Played a lot with CSS to make my design responsive

TO DO: 
- Resize image coming to respond better with mobile devices
- Add an API link to the "Get Comics" button
      - Need to store character ID from character name search (results array)
           - Only way to call the Comics with that character is with "characterID"
